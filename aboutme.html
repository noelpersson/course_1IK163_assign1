                <h3>Who am i?</h3>
                <p>My name is Noel Persson, and I am 22 years old. I grew up in a small town called Kramfors, located about 100 kilometers north of Sundsvall in Sweden. Life in Kramfors shaped me with its close-knit community and the beauty of nature that surrounded me.</p>
                <p>I come from a lively household with three siblings, which taught me the value of family and teamwork from an early age. Growing up, I was also lucky to share my life with two wonderful dogs, Tera and Truls, who brought energy and joy to our home.</p>

                <p>In the picture above, you can see my childhood home, a house my father built with his own hands. This home holds countless memories and is a reflection of hard work and creativity. The house is beautifully situated just 20 meters from a large lake, a place that played a significant role in my upbringing.</p>
                <p>The lake wasn’t just a picturesque backdrop; it was the heart of many adventures. We had a motorboat, perfect for exciting trips and exploring the water, as well as a smaller rowboat, which became a quiet escape for fishing or simply enjoying the stillness of nature. Growing up so close to the lake gave me a deep appreciation for the outdoors, and many of my happiest memories involve days spent on or by the water.</p>

                <h2>My interests</h2>
                <p>I haven’t always been passionate about technology and programming. Before I discovered the fascinating world of coding, my heart was set on something completely different: airplanes. I was captivated by everything about them – their design, their engineering, and the sense of freedom they represent.</p>
                <h3>Airplanes</h3>
                <p>As a child, I would spend hours reading about airplanes, watching documentaries, and dreaming of one day becoming a pilot. The idea of soaring through the skies and mastering these incredible machines filled me with excitement. However, as I grew older and began exploring the requirements for becoming a pilot, I faced a hard truth: my ADHD would prevent me from pursuing that dream. It was a tough realization, and for a time, it felt like the door to a future I had envisioned was firmly shut. "I haven’t let go of my passion for airplanes entirely. Whenever I get the chance, I seize the opportunity to fly and reconnect with the fascination that first inspired me."</p>

                <p>But this challenge also taught me resilience and the importance of finding new passions. While I couldn’t follow my dream of flying, I eventually discovered programming – a world where I could channel my creativity, problem-solving skills, and focus in a way that felt just as exciting. Coding became my new frontier, offering endless possibilities to create, innovate, and push boundaries.</p>
                <h3>Tech interests</h3>
                <p>I started my programming journey at the age of 12 with HTML and CSS, building the foundation for creating structured and visually appealing web pages. As my curiosity grew, I discovered WordPress and quickly became fascinated by its potential. This led me to learn PHP, allowing me to develop custom themes and plugins to create unique, functional websites. From there, I transitioned to JavaScript, driven by my interest in building more advanced web applications. JavaScript opened the door to interactivity and dynamic functionality, which fueled my passion for modern web development. To further enhance my skills, I embraced TypeScript for its structure and type safety and dove into React to master component-based development, transforming how I approach web applications.</p>

                <figcaption class="figcaption">Photo from Adobe Stock</figcaption>
                <p>Beyond web development, I explored other programming languages to broaden my skill set. Python became a favorite for its simplicity and versatility in automation and data processing. My fascination with Excel led me to learn Visual Basic, which allowed me to automate repetitive tasks and boost productivity. During my studies at LNU, I added Java to my repertoire, gaining a solid understanding of object-oriented programming and large-scale systems development. These diverse experiences have shaped me into a well-rounded programmer with a passion for solving problems and building innovative solutions.</p>
                <a href="myjourney.html" class="aboutme-background-button">See journey</a>
                <p>I also have a strong passion for computers and servers, which has become a significant part of my technical journey. I manage my own servers, ranging from file storage solutions to web servers, providing me with hands-on experience in server management and optimization. This hobby allows me to explore the intricate workings of networking, storage, and system administration, fueling my curiosity for how systems operate behind the scenes.</p>
                <p>One of my key interests lies in server automation. I enjoy finding ways to streamline repetitive tasks, optimize server performance, and enhance reliability through automation. Whether it's setting up automated backups, deploying updates, or configuring services to run seamlessly, I am always looking for ways to make systems more efficient and self-sustaining. This fascination with automation not only improves my technical skills but also aligns with my broader goal of using technology to simplify and improve processes.</p>
